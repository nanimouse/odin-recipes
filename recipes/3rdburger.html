        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>3 cloves garlice, coarsely chopped </li> <br>
            <li> butter or olive oil </li> <br>
            <li> 10 oz white buttom mushrooms, sliced </li> <br>
            <li> 2 roma tomatoes, seeded and diced </li> <br>
            <li> 1 c brown gravy </li> <br>
            <li> 1/4 c brown mustard </li> <br>
            <li> 1 lb ground beef </li> <br>
            <li> 4 slices baby Swiss cheese </li> <br>
            <li> 4 slices Jarlsberg cheese </li> <br>
            <li> 4 hamburger buns </li> <br>
            <li> Boston or green leaf lettuce </li> 
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Sauté the garlic in a little butter or oil over medium-high heat just until fragrant. Fragrance is like obscenity: You'll know it when you smell it. Turn the heat down to medium and add the mushrooms and a bit more butter or oil. Cook these slowly to soften them up and draw out their liquid </li> <br>
            <li> Once your mushrooms are starting to brown, raise the heat to high till the liquid evaporates. Throw in your diced tomatoes and sauté briefly. Set aside. </li> <br>
            <li> Heat your gravy—scratch, a can, or a mix—you'll want it hot.
            </li> <br>
            <li> Gently mix the mustard into the beef. Form 4 hamburger patties and season both sides with salt and pepper. Cook the burgers.
            </li> <br>
            <li> Put a bit of your mushroom-garlic-tomato mixture on top and then add one slice each of the Swiss and the Jarlsberg. </li> <br>
            <li> Build Your Burger: Bottom bun, lettuce, cheesy-mushroomy burger, more mushrooms, gravy, top bun. Reserve any leftover gravy for dipping fries. </li>
        </ol>

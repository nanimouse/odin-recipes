        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li> 1/2 lb bacon </li> <br>
            <li> 1/3 lb Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced </li> <br>
            <li> 1/4 c shelled pistachios, roughly chopped </li> <br>
            <li> kosher salt </li> <br>
            <li> freshly ground black pepper </li> <br>
            <li> 1 lb ground beef </li> <br>
            <li> 4 hamburger buns </li> <br>
            <li> green leaf lettuce </li> <br>
            <li> sour cream </li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Cook your bacon on the stove in a large frying pan set over low heat. Cook the bacon until it's crispy, but not too crispy. </li> <br>
            <li> Transfer your bacon to paper towels, and throw your Brussels sprouts into that delicious bacon fat; increase the heat to medium-high. You could cook garden tools in bacon fat and they would taste good. That's a fact!** </li> <br>
            <li> Once the sprouts start to brown a bit, add the pistachios. Stir for about a minute, then remove from heat and set aside </li> <br>
            <li> Season the beef with the salt and pepper, form 4 patties, and cook your burgers in the same pan </li> <br>
            <li> Build Your Burger: Bottom bun, burger, bacon, Brussels sprouts mixture, a dollop of sour cream, and your top bun. Dollop. Dollop. That's a great word, dollop.> </li>
        </ol>
